Welcome to the course 

I will be using the linux terminal to program during the course, but you are welcome to use any text editor and compiler you wish to.

What I will use - (Works for Linux and Mac):

 - I will use brew through the course, so please download it: http://brew.sh.

 - after you get brew installed, type the follwing to install python 3 on your machine: $ brew install python.

 - I will be using vim and I recomend that you get the latest version by typing the following command in terminal: $ brew install vim. brew will let you know the version you have and if you need to update.


Other ways that work on all operating systems:
 
 - install python 3.6.5 through the following link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-macosx10.6.pkg

 - install pycharm through this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
